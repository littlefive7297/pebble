	// - flusher.ready is a condition variable that is signalled when there is
	//   work to do. Full blocks are contained in flusher.pending. The current
	//   partial block is in LogWriter.block. And sync operations are held in
	//   flusher.syncQ.
	//
	// - The decision to sync is determined by whether there are any sync
	//   requests present in flusher.syncQ and whether enough time has elapsed
	//   since the last sync. If not enough time has elapsed since the last sync,
	//   flusher.syncQ.blocked will be set to 1. If syncing is blocked,
	//   syncQueue.empty() will return true and syncQueue.load() will return 0,0
	//   (i.e. an empty list).

	// - flusher.syncQ.blocked is cleared by a timer that is initialized when
	//   blocked is set to 1. When blocked is 1, no syncing will take place, but
	//   flushing will continue to be performed. The on/off toggle for syncing
	//   does not need to be carefully synchronized with the rest of processing
	//   -- all we need to ensure is that after any transition to blocked=1 there
